# Dish.

Dish is an Android based app that enables users to endorse their favorite foods at               
restaurants by providing pictures and comments. The app was created to assist local business              
that may not have strong a strong social media presence or that are unknown local hangouts. It                
also assists users who do not know what the best single dish at a given restaurant is. The app                   
is supported by backend services that are hosted on AWS, this increases availability of the app                
during peak usage times. Information is recorded in a relational database and is readily              
available for retrieval as users explore their current environment.
